## Near Future

- palette generation based on iteration depth
- switch fast inside program: LDA #65 / STA $0
- hack Q opcodes into xemu
- switch to Q opcodes
- Timing via CIA2 inside assembler
- display timing on the graphic screen

## Later (Explorer Stuff)

- select region & render region
- change iterations
- lowres mode for exploring
- add higher hires? (640x400 possible?)
